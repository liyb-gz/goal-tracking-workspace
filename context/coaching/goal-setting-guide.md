# Goal Setting Sessions

How to facilitate goal-setting at any level (yearly, monthly, daily).

## Session Flow

### Opening

1. **Check context:** What period are we setting goals for?
2. **Load parent goals:** If monthly, show yearly; if daily, show monthly
3. **Gauge energy:** "How are you feeling about goal-setting today?"

### Exploration (Adaptive)

**If user is vague:**

-   Walk through each active domain
-   Ask about aspirations, challenges, opportunities
-   Help them articulate what "better" looks like

**If user has ideas:**

-   Clarify and refine what they've shared
-   Check alignment with parent goals
-   Probe for gaps in their thinking

### Refinement

For each emerging goal, check:

1. **Clarity** — Is it specific enough to know when it's done? (SMART-lite)
2. **Meaning** — Why does this matter? (Reflection-heavy)
3. **Feasibility** — Is this realistic given current capacity? (Energy-aware)
4. **Balance** — How does this fit with other domains? (Domain-balanced)

Don't enforce rigid SMART format, but ensure goals are actionable and meaningful.

### Prioritization

If multiple goals:

-   Ask which 1-3 are highest priority
-   Suggest sequencing others rather than dropping
-   Flag if load seems unsustainable

### Closing

1. Summarize agreed goals
2. Write to appropriate file (yearly/monthly/daily)
3. Note any open questions or tentative items
4. Express genuine confidence in their capacity (not over-the-top)

## Goal Hierarchy

| Session | Load Parent Goals                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Yearly  | None (top level)                             |
| Monthly | Current yearly goals                         |
| Daily   | Current monthly goals (yearly for reference) |

Reference parent goals to maintain alignment:

> "Your yearly goal is to build financial foundation. How does this month support that?"

## By Session Type

### Yearly Goals

-   Big-picture visioning
-   Cover all active domains
-   1-3 primary themes or objectives per priority domain
-   A yearly theme is helpful but optional

### Monthly Goals

-   Derive from yearly goals
-   Specific focus areas for the month
-   Capacity check: What's realistic this month?
-   Account for known events, travel, busy periods

### Daily Targets

-   Concrete actions for today
-   Aligned with monthly goals
-   1-3 meaningful targets, not a huge list
-   Energy-appropriate (morning = more ambitious, evening = less)

## Goal Quality Checklist

For each goal, ensure:

-   [ ] Clear enough to know when done
-   [ ] Connected to why it matters
-   [ ] Realistic given current capacity
-   [ ] Balanced with other life areas

Don't enforce rigidly — adapt to user's style.

## Goal File Format

Write goals with this structure:

```markdown
## [Domain]: [Goal Statement]

**Why:** Brief meaning/motivation
**Milestones:** Key checkpoints (if applicable)
**Status:** Active | Achieved | Revised | Dropped

---
```

## Handling Resistance

If user seems reluctant:

-   Check if timing is off: "Is now a good time for this?"
-   Reduce scope: "What if we just picked one focus?"
-   Name it: "You seem hesitant. What's coming up?"

Don't push. Sometimes the answer is "not today."
