## Daily Summary Flow

### Gather

1. Check today's file for targets that were set
2. Query active data sources (if configured)
3. Note what data is available vs. missing

### Quick Prompts (3-5 questions)

**If targets exist:**

-   "Looking at your targets, what got done?"
-   "Anything that didn't happen? What got in the way?"

**If data sources available:**

-   "I see [observation from data]. What's the story there?"

**Always:**

-   "Any wins worth noting today?"
-   "Anything you'd do differently?"
-   "Anything on your mind for tomorrow?"

### Adaptive Depth

-   If they're tired: Keep it light, 3 questions max
-   If they want to process: Give space for longer answers
-   Read their energy

### Write Summary

Update the day's file with:

-   What was accomplished
-   Notable moments or insights
-   Anything carrying forward to tomorrow

## Weekly Summary Flow

### Gather

-   Read all daily files for the week
-   Note which days have summaries vs. gaps
-   Look for patterns

### Synthesis Prompts

-   "Here's what I noticed this week: [patterns]. What stands out to you?"
-   "How did this week move you toward your monthly goals?"
-   "What worked well? What would you adjust?"

### Write Summary

-   Key accomplishments
-   Progress on monthly goals
-   Patterns noticed
-   Challenges and lessons
-   Intentions for next week

---

## Monthly Summary Flow

### Gather

-   Load monthly goals from start of month
-   Load all weekly summaries
-   Load yearly goals for context

### Review Each Goal

For each goal set at month start:

-   What was the outcome?
-   Status: Achieved / Partial / Revised / Not pursued
-   What enabled or hindered progress?
-   Lessons learned

### Synthesis

-   What themes emerged across the month?
-   Energy and capacity patterns?
-   How did this month advance yearly intentions?

### Time Estimation Calibration

Compare estimated vs actual time spent on goals:
-   "You estimated X hours/week for [goal] — how close was that?"
-   Note significant over/underestimates for future calibration
-   If pattern emerges (consistently underestimating): "I'm noticing you tend to underestimate time for [type] goals — worth building in more buffer next month?"
-   Include in summary: "Time estimates were [accurate / optimistic / conservative] this month"

### Write Summary

Add summary section to monthly goals file

---

## Yearly Summary Flow

### Gather

-   Load yearly goals
-   Load all monthly summaries
-   This is a deeper session — check user's available time

### Review the Year

-   Did the yearly theme hold? Evolve?
-   Goal by goal: Achieved / Partial / Evolved / Released
-   What months felt best? Hardest?

### Growth Reflection

-   How are you different than a year ago?
-   What are you proudest of?
-   What would you do differently?

### Bridge to Next Year

-   What continues?
-   What new intentions emerge?

## Rollup Principle

Higher-level summaries should:

-   Reference lower-level summaries, not raw daily data
-   Synthesize patterns, not repeat details
-   Connect back to goals at that level
-   Look for trajectory, not just snapshots

---

## Handling Goal Revisions in Summaries

When goals were revised during the summary period:
- Review both active and retired goals from the goal file
- For each revised/released goal: What prompted the change? Was it the right call?
- Track the full arc: original intention → revision → outcome
- Include a `Date Revised` column in the Goal Outcomes table
- Frame revisions positively: changing course is a sign of self-awareness, not failure

---

## Handling Incomplete Data

1. **State coverage honestly:** "This summary covers 4 of 7 days this week"
2. **Work with what exists** — don't fabricate or assume
3. **Note patterns in gaps** if relevant (curious, not judgmental)
4. **Optional reflection:** "What was happening during [gap]?"
5. **No guilt** — gaps are information, not failures

## Summary Output Format

```markdown
## Summary: [Date/Week/Month/Year]

### Accomplishments

-   [Bullet points by domain or theme]

### Challenges

-   [What didn't go as planned]

### Insights

-   [Learnings, patterns, realizations]

### Carrying Forward

-   [What continues into next period]

---

Generated: [timestamp]
Coverage: [X of Y days/weeks]
```

## Closing

1. Confirm summary captures what matters
2. Note anything to carry forward
3. Brief acknowledgment of effort — genuine, not effusive
