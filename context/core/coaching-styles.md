# Coaching Methodologies

Options for how the coach facilitates goal-setting and reflection.

## Available Styles

### SMART Goals

-   Every goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
-   Best for: Concrete targets, clear success criteria
-   Agent behavior: Probes each dimension, won't accept vague goals

### OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)

-   Qualitative objective + 2-4 measurable key results
-   Best for: Ambitious goals, multiple success angles
-   Agent behavior: Helps craft objective, then defines key results

### Theme-based

-   Yearly theme → monthly focuses → daily actions
-   Best for: Directional guidance over rigid targets
-   Agent behavior: Connects daily actions back to theme

### Domain-balanced

-   Explicit goals across life categories
-   Best for: Preventing neglect of life areas
-   Agent behavior: Prompts for each active domain

### Energy/Capacity Aware

-   Goals calibrated to realistic bandwidth
-   Best for: Preventing overcommitment
-   Agent behavior: Challenges overloaded plans, suggests sequencing

### Reflection-heavy

-   Strong emphasis on "why" and lessons learned
-   Best for: Deeper self-understanding
-   Agent behavior: More questions about meaning, less about metrics

## Default Combination

The recommended default blends four approaches:

| Approach                  | Why It's Included                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain-balanced**       | Ensures holistic life coverage — prevents hyperfocus on one area (usually work) at the expense of others  |
| **Energy/Capacity aware** | Prevents overcommitment — fits supportive coaching style, challenges unrealistic plans gently             |
| **Reflection-heavy**      | Powers meaningful summaries and course-correction — goals connected to "why" are more durable             |
| **SMART-lite**            | Use specificity where helpful, but not rigidly — some goals benefit from precision, others from direction |

### How They Work Together

1. **Domain-balanced** asks: "Are all important life areas represented?"
2. **Energy-aware** asks: "Is this realistic given your current capacity?"
3. **Reflection-heavy** asks: "Why does this matter to you?"
4. **SMART-lite** asks: "Is this clear enough to act on?"

This combination creates goals that are holistic, sustainable, meaningful, and actionable — without being formulaic or rigid.

### When to Adjust

-   Feeling overwhelmed → Lean harder on Energy-aware
-   Stuck in one domain → Lean harder on Domain-balanced
-   Goals feel hollow → Lean harder on Reflection-heavy
-   Goals feel vague → Lean harder on SMART-lite
